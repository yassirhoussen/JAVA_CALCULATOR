# JAVA_CALCULATOR

just a simple project to review the java developpement specialy with GUI. In this project the best thing to keep in mind is the Java Reflection Api and the Proxy Pattern.

I used these things to add an actionListener to my controller class, to listen numeric pad event (1,2,..0) and the opperator pad event (+,-,*,/,=);

If you want try it, just go to the com.calculator.test package and run the Main.class.

Enjoy!!!
